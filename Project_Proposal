# Project Proposal Linear Regression

## Predicting TV Show Ratings on IMDB

The goal of this project is to predict the rating of a TV Show on IMDB. To predict the scores, it is important to understand the different features that are affecting a show's rating. The film industry can use this model to predict how well their show is doing according to features. 

Webscraping using Selenium and BeautifulSoup will be needed to retrieve data from IMDB.com. I will be obtaining all the shows that are listed on IMDB and using the data obtained by websraping to predict a show's rating level. Features that may affect TV rating levels include:
- Genre
- Awards
- Stars
- Creator
- Number of Episodes
- Official Streaming Site
- Production Company 
- Runtime
- Release Date
- Certifcations

Tools that I will be using to achieve this prediciton includes:
- BeautifulSoup to webscrape
- Selenium to webscrape
- Pandas to make dataframes and analyze
- Matplotlib/Seaborn to visualize features and target value
- Sklearn to perform statistical computation on IMDB data
